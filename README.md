# Weather-Journal App Project

## Overview
This project requires you to create an asynchronous web app that uses Web API and user data to dynamically update the UI. 

## Instructions
This will require modifying the `server.js` file and the `website/app.js` file. You can see `index.html` for element references, and once you are finished with the project steps, you can use `style.css` to style your application to customized perfection.

## Extras
If you are interested in testing your code as you go, you can use `tests.js` as a template for writing and running some basic tests for your code.

## Instructions
To run this start the server in the console via
    node server.js
Where server.js is the server javaScript file and is located at the same level as the main porject folder.
Make sure to run node in the correct directory.
Once the server is up and running, go to localhost:8000 in your browser (or whatever port was chosen)
After that you're good to go.
